`window.nostr` capability for web browsers
------------------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:fiatjaf`

The `window.nostr` object may be made available by web browsers or extensions and websites or web-apps may make use of it after checking its availability.

That object must define the following methods:

```
async window.nostr.getPublicKey(): string // returns a public key as hex
async window.nostr.signEvent(event: Event): Event // takes an event object, adds `id`, `pubkey` and `sig` and returns it
```

Aside from these two basic above, the following functions can also be implemented optionally:
```
async window.nostr.getRelays(): { [url: string]: {read: boolean, write: boolean} } // returns a basic map of relay urls to relay policies
async window.nostr.nip04.encrypt(pubkey, plaintext): string // returns ciphertext and iv as specified in nip-04
async window.nostr.nip04.decrypt(pubkey, ciphertext): string // takes ciphertext and iv as specified in nip-04
```

### User experience recommendation
Due to the way browsers load the extensions, it may take some time for `window.nostr` object will be fully ready to accept requests.  Hence, it is a good idea to run the first `window.nostr` interaction on a user action on the web page (like a button click), and not during the page load.  

Calling the `window.nostr` based methods during the page load runs the risk of intermittent issues due to race conditions between the client page's script and the extension's script
